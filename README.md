## Stat 159 Project 1: First Reproducible Project

**Author**: Ellen Hwang

**Description**: The purpose of this project is to get familiarized with computational tools such as bash, markdown, pandoc, git, github, and Make. Within this project, I will also describe my process in learning these tools.

**Project Structure**: Makefile holds instructions to compile parts of the paper. There are two folders: paper and images. The paper folder holds the entire paper in two formats and its sections in the secions folders. The images folders holds images to be used in the paper.

**Steps**:
1. Run `make` to ensure paper.md is compiled
2. go into the paper folder to open the report in the .html or .md format
