## ABSTRACT:

The purpose of this project is to help myself and others familiarize with computational tools such as bash, markdown, pandoc, git, github, and Make. For each of these tools, I will explain its purpose and its role in a project and workflow. Within this project, I will also describe my process in learning these tools such as the resources I used and my struggles in doing the project.
